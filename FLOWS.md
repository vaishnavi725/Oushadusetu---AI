## The big picture (one story)

```
Pharmacy sends request  →  System checks it (rules)  →  Staff fix problems (if any)
      →  Provider decides  →  Pharmacy gets approval  →  Pharmacy fills medicine
      →  Patient is told at every step  →  Case closes
```

**Who does what:**
| Person | Job in the app |
|---|---|
| **Pharmacy** (Omar, Grace, Lena) | Sends refill requests. Fills the medicine. |
| **Practice staff** (Jordan, Sam) | Fixes problems: wrong patient, missing info, insurance. |
| **Provider / doctor** (Dr. Rao, Marcus Chen) | Approves or denies. Only they can decide. |
| **Practice admin** (Priya) | Manages the team and settings. Can break things on purpose (simulator). |
| **Patient** (no login) | Opens a link and sees the status. |

3. Click **Read fax with AI**.
4. The form fills in by itself, with the fax shown on the left.

6. Click **Send request**.
7. You see **"Request RB-10xx sent"** with the status **Waiting on provider**.
   → The system found the problems by itself: *no refills left* and *A1c blood test overdue*.

   - **Closed** → finished.
2. Click any card to open it.
3. You only see **initials** (like "A.P.") and the birth year. No full name and no doctor notes. This is on purpose, for privacy.

### 2C. Fill an approved medicine

2. Click the buttons in order:
   **Confirm receipt → Start filling → Mark ready for pickup → Mark dispensed**
